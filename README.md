# Gabibi-Algo

Algorithm inspired by the national CyberChallengeIT 2023 competition, where was the following problem proposed ...

## Problem

There are two player (two gabibis), each one on a tower consists of a stack of red and blue rectangle. 
You can do two moves: the "red move" makes the players descend from a rectangle only if the player is on a red rectangle, and the "blue move" only if the single player is on a blue rectangle. 
The goal of the game is to make both the players reach the second-to-last level of the tower.
